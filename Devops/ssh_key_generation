If you already have a SSH key, then don't a generate new key, as they will be overwritten. You can use ssh-keygen command

>>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "aneekhara@some.com"

When you run the above command, it will create 2 files in the ~/.ssh directory. ( id_rsa , id_rsa.pub )
~/.ssh/id_rsa − It is private key or identification key.
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub − It is a public tv.

when you are using server - .ssh will be generated at the root folder 
Your identification has been saved in /data/home/svc_tas_int/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /data/home/svc_tas_int/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:cTTXQOFcrVBtr206Xr3mJj3F832EkUGP6Ez47NqNJQY aneekhara@some.com
eg - svc_tas_int@awsmblx500bs024
	/data/home/svc_tas_int

if you are using normal gitbash shell - .ssh/ will be generated in that directory only  

>>cd 
to go to gome directory 
( in server - /data/home/svc_tas_int , and public key at /data/home/svc_tas_int/.ssh/id_rsa.pub )

>> cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa randomlogkey aneekhara@some.com


connect it to server ( paste the public key in the gerrit , profile -> setting -> ssh key ) 

Now you can use the commands like clone , pull , cherry-pick ....
