shows the differences between various states of a repository.
It helps developers see what changes have been made, whether they are between the working directory and the staging area, between the staging area and the last commit, or between any two commits.

the difference between the last commit and working directory / Viewing Changes Between Commits 
  1. Comparing Working Directory and Staging Area ( index ) 
     unstaged changes, tracked files that are not yet added to the staging area with git add, changes that have been made in your working directory but are not yet staged
     git diff 
  
  Stage the Changes means git add commands

  2. Comparing the Staging area (index) and the last commit. 
     staged changes, what you have staged using git add, staged but not yet committed
     git diff --cached
     OR
     git diff --staged

  3. Comparing Working Directory and Last Commit ( both staged and unstaged changes )
     git diff HEAD



Comparing a Commit and the Working Directory - ( difference after specific commit and working directory )
git diff <commit_hash>

Changes between two Commits
git diff <commit_hash1> <commit_hash2>

Comparing Two Branches
git diff branch1 branch2 - shows the changes that would be needed to transform branch1 into branch2
eg. - git diff master origin/master

Comparing a File
git diff <branch> <branch> -- <file_path>
