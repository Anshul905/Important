"git stash" --> saves your local modifications and reverts your working directory to match the last commit ( does not included Untracked Files )
"git stash -u" --> also includes Untracked Files 
check git status

"git stash pop [<stash>]"  --> to reapply the changes ( in LIFO manner )you previously saved with git stash and then remove the stash entry from the stash list.
                           --> latest one will be popped out first
"git stash pop"         --> If you don’t specify a stash, it applies the most recent one


"git stash apply [<stash>]" --> same as pop but stash entry is not removed from the stash list after applying it. 
                            --> This means you can apply the same stash multiple times or keep it for future use.
"git stash apply " --> If you don’t specify a stash, it applies the most recent one


"git stash list" --> list of all stashes
