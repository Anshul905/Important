used to fetch all changes from the remote repository to the local repository. 
It doesnâ€™t make any changes to the current working directory. 
It stores all the changes in a separate branch called the remote-tracking branch
git merge or git rebase command is used to merge these changes into our current working directory.

??????????? If you want to see the difference between local and remote.
First, you can fetch the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local branch.
git fetch
This will update your local copy of the remote branches without altering your working directory.

Next, use the git diff command to compare your local branch with the remote branch
git diff <local_branch> <remote>/<branch>
?????????? if you want to compare your local main branch with the remote origin/main branch 
git diff main origin/main 
?????????? If you want to see the differences between your working directory (including unstaged changes) and the remote branch, you can directly compare the current branch with the remote branch
git diff origin/main
